# Neighborhood Map
This project employs Knockout js, Google Map and FourSquare apis

## User's input
1 User can:
- Allow App to get location.
- Enter State, zip code (postal code or region) and Country.

2 Enter places of interest e.g Hotel, pizza etc. FourSquare will return a maximum of ten places

3 Once this process is complete, map will be displayed with all places of interest markers and user location marker. 
A click on each marker will display place details from both FourSquare and Google Map.

4 From the results displayed, user can search for group of interests or specific interest. 

5 When user clicks on a place, the following will occur:
  - Display directional map from user location to the specific place
  - Click on more `detail` and the place panoramic view, details and directional text will be displayed.

## Wish list
- The new yelp Fusion API call is presently a challenge. yelp does not accept neither localhost nor github to host for testing.
- Save search result and maps on the local storage (jquery, Backbone, etc.)
